Hello,

If you want to take part in the Alliance with the status of ***invitee***, please complete the form below.

This registration will give you access to all the information and activities contained in the Algosphere. You will be able to participate fully, albeit without decision-making power.

You will receive an email in the days following your registration, putting you in contact with an ally who will accompany you as you become acquainted with the Alliance.

Afterwards, if you wish to become an ***ally***, your accompanying ally will assist you in this process. Unlike the invitee status, that of ally confers decision-making power.

Best wishes!

        <h2>Do I become an ally simply by registering?</h2>
        <p>No, you will just have the status of <a class="abbr" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover" data-placement="bottom" title="Constitution:" data-content="« The status of invitee allows anyone to participate in the Alliance's internal discussions. This status gives them the right to make proposals and discuss, but not to make decisions. »" tabindex="0"><strong><em>invitee</em></strong></a>.<br>
        However, registration provides access to the collaborative platform of the Alliance, allowing you to discover all its activities and even take part in them.</p>
        <p>Later, you can ask to become an <strong><em>ally</em></strong>, the sole condition being that you <em>consider the alleviation of suffering in the world to be an ethical priority</em>.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>Can I register and participate anonymously?</h2>
        <p>Yes, there is no verification of identity. You can register with the email address of your choice and ask to unsubscribe at any time.</p>
        <p>Taking part anonymously in the Algosphere is possible, but keep in mind that the Alliance works according to the principle of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_transparency">radical transparency</a>. It is up to you whether to give personal information or not.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>What happens after registration?</h2>
        <p>The Algosphere provides you with an <strong><em>accompanying</em></strong> ally. You can ask this ally to help you get started.</p>
        <p>If you already know someone in the Alliance, you can mention this at the time of registration to help us identify an accompanying ally that fits you, but you can change your accompanying ally at any time.</p>
        <p>In the days following your registration, you will receive an email putting you in contact with them. This ally therefore has knowledge of your email address.</p>
        <p>After your registration you will begin receiving:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>the AlgoNews quarterly;</li>
          <li>the monthly notification of decisions submitted to the Alliance.</li>
        </ul>
