From the point of view of moral philosophy, [speciesism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speciesism) is the discrimination of [sentient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentience) individuals on the basis of their species. From a sociological point of view, it is the social organization based on animal exploitation, accompanied by the ideology of human supremacism, which assigns non-humans an inferior moral status..

The Algosphere Alliance wants suffering to be given equal consideration, regardless of the species of the individual experiencing it, human or non-human. It supports efforts against speciesism, starting with the *[World Day for the End of Speciesism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Day_for_the_End_of_Speciesism)* ([official website](https://www.end-of-speciesism.org/en/)).
