{{< quote "[Constitution](/about/governance/constitution/)" >}}
The Alliance's **Communication Committee** is responsible for the administration of the Alliance's information system, including its Internet sites. As such, it has the mandate to decide on the presentation of information validated by the Alliance without requiring its prior accord: the Alliance can demand modifications a posteriori. This committee liaises with the [Algosphere Agency](https://www.ic.gc.ca/app/scr/cc/CorporationsCanada/fdrlCrpDtls.html?corpId=8368970), which is legally responsible for the Alliance's website [algosphere.org](https://algosphere.org).

The members of the **Communication Committee** are authorized to handle proposals that they judge to be minor (on the condition that they are at least 2 to handle each proposal).

From 28 July 2013, only the Communication Committee, which has webmaster responsibilities, is mandated to integrate decisions made by the Alliance into the Collaborative Platform.
